This is my first project using php. it includes a simple user form including, first name, last name, email, gender, age, a comment section, and a password. This user form is used to log in securely to a database handled by phpMyAdmin. Created a secure connection to apache server. Added the ability to edit and delete users in the database, also a function to order users by name or id.
